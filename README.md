# delaunay-walls
The idea for this project came from a wondering thought of "How hard would it be for games like CoD or CSGO to implement more dynamic gameplay by being able to break walls with grenades and such?"
This lead me to wanting to break a wall into multiple peices which in turn lead me the wonderful wiki page for delaunay triangulations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) which then lead to me implementing a delaunay triangulation contruction algorithm in a unity project and mixing in a bit of physics to make a fun project.![Example of one of the generated triangulations created in my project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62516857/138609428-89ffef07-59f1-421d-b299-9676b24190b6.png)
